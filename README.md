# Repo houses all files for in class work for CPS493

Growing up I was around computers and electronics a ton. My dad is very tech savvy, teaching himself almost everything he knows. This rubbed off on me from a young age. I was lucky enough that my high school offered computer science courses while I was there and that paired with a great teacher really opened my eyes to what could be done with computers. The first big project I ever created was the game Snake. With that being said, I became overwhelmed very quickly as well. There are so many fields within comp sci, and it took until after my gap year to really figure out what I loved doing. This would be data science. Last semester for a project I created the database for what would serve as the foundation for my Fantasy Baseball Helper app (work in progress still).

I see this course helping a ton when it comes to being able to make user friendly versions of an app or project idea I may have. Being able to make logins for each specific user is huge along with countless other big features and quality of life features I could implement.
